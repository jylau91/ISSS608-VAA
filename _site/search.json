It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling the ggplot() function using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot()` initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (in later part of this lesson, you will see that each geom layer can have its own aes specification)\nCode chunk below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the y scale is not very useful and misleading, we will turn it off using scale_y_continous() and change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()       \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha outside aes()Alpha inside aes()\n\n\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS, fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = \"grey30\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(title = \"Alpha Outside aes()\",\n       subtitle = \"Cleaner legend, same transparency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS, fill = GENDER, alpha = 0.6)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = \"grey30\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alpha Inside aes()\",\n       subtitle = \"Legend includes alpha mapping (even though it's constant)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSetting alpha outside of aes() will not include a redundant legend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess, it can be overriden using the method argument as below.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n\nWarning: package 'ggpmisc' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: ggpp\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggpp' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggpp':\n  method                  from   \n  heightDetails.titleGrob ggplot2\n  widthDetails.titleGrob  ggplot2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'ggpp'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\n\n\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  stat_poly_eq(\n    formula = y ~ x,\n    aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = \"~~~\")),\n    parse = TRUE\n  )\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..eq.label..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(eq.label)` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n-   [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out). \n-   [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped. \n-   [`coord_fixed()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html): a cartesian system with a \"fixed\" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a \"widescreen\" plot). \n-   [`coord_quickmap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()"

It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."
