This visualization helps establish an overview of the national population balance across life stages and reveals immediate trends—such as ageing, fertility shifts, and gender imbalances at older ages. It serves as a foundational snapshot to ground our subsequent spatial exploration.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# === STEP 1: Find the Maximum Age ===\nmax_age <- max(df$Age_Num, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# === STEP 2: Prepare the Data ===\nplot_df <- df %>%\n  mutate(\n    AgeGroup = cut(\n      Age_Num,\n      breaks = if (max_age > 90) {\n        c(seq(0, 85, by = 5), 90, max_age + 1)\n      } else {\n        c(seq(0, 85, by = 5), max_age + 1)\n      },\n      right = FALSE,\n      labels = if (max_age > 90) {\n        c(paste0(seq(0, 80, by = 5), \"-\", seq(4, 84, by = 5)), \"90+\")\n      } else {\n        c(paste0(seq(0, 80, by = 5), \"-\", seq(4, 84, by = 5)), \"90+\")\n      }\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(AgeGroup, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Population = sum(Population), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Population = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", -Population, Population),\n    PopulationAbs = abs(Population)\n  )\n\n# === STEP 3: Plot ===\nggplot(plot_df, aes(x = AgeGroup, y = Population, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.90, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = format(PopulationAbs, big.mark = \",\")),\n    size = 4.5,\n    color = \"black\",\n    hjust = ifelse(plot_df$Sex == \"Males\", -0.05, 1.05),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Singapore's Population Pyramid (2024) by 5-Year Age Groups\",\n    x = \"Age Group\",\n    y = \"Population Size\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = function(x) format(abs(x), big.mark = \",\", scientific = FALSE),\n    limits = c(-200000, 200000),\n    breaks = seq(-200000, 200000, by = 50000),\n    minor_breaks = seq(-200000, 200000, by = 25000)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Males\" = \"#87CEFA\", \"Females\" = \"#FFB6C1\"),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = \"grey85\", size = 0.3)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](takehome_ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Insights**\n\n-   Singapore’s population pyramid shows a shrinking base and bulging middle, reflecting a rapidly aging society and declining birth rates.\n-   Adults aged 30–54 form the bulk of the population—critical for workforce planning and economic policy.\n-   A gender disparity emerges past age 70, where females significantly outnumber males, consistent with global longevity trends.\n:::\n\n### 3.2 Age Distribution by Region\n\nWhile the population pyramid offers a valuable national overview, it does not reveal where these demographic segments are concentrated within Singapore. To explore this spatial dimension, we now turn to age distribution density plots by region. These plots enable us to compare the relative age profiles across Singapore’s five regions, highlighting differences in median age, spread, and peak density. This step is critical in understanding regional population characteristics that can inform location-specific planning and policy decisions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# === STEP 1: Prepare Overall Population-weighted Data ===\noverall_df <- df %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_Num)) %>%\n  group_by(Region, Age_Num) %>%\n  summarise(Population = sum(Population), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  uncount(weights = Population)\n\n# === STEP 2: Compute Peak Age by Region ===\noverall_peaks <- overall_df %>%\n  group_by(Region) %>%\n  summarise(\n    d = list(density(Age_Num)),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(\n    peak_x = d$x[which.max(d$y)],\n    label = paste0(Region, \" - Peak Age: \", round(peak_x))\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# === STEP 3: Combine Labels for Annotation ===\noverall_annotation <- paste(overall_peaks$label, collapse = \"\\n\")\n\n# === STEP 4: Create Overall Density Plot ===\noverall_plot <- ggplot(overall_df, aes(x = Age_Num, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = Inf, vjust = 1.2,\n           label = overall_annotation, hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = \"italic\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 90, 10)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age Distribution (2024): Overall\",\n    subtitle = \"Density by Region with Y-axis scaled per chart\",\n    x = \"Age\", y = \"Relative Density\", fill = \"Region\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),\n    axis.text.x  = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.text.y  = element_text(size = 14),\n    panel.border = element_rect(color = \"grey50\", fill = NA),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n# === STEP 5: Render ===\noverall_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](takehome_ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Insights**\n\n-   The North-East region has the highest peak median age (42), indicating a more mature residential population.\n-   East and Central regions peak around age 32–35, possibly due to a higher concentration of young professionals and families.\n-   Uniform density across regions from age 25–45 suggests consistent workforce presence across Singapore, but divergence after age 50 reflects varying residential preferences among older adults.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 3.3 Violin and Boxplot - Age Distribution by Planning Area per Region\n\nHaving observed regional patterns, we now dive deeper into planning areas within each region to uncover more localized demographic variation. Using a combination of violin and boxplots, this section visualizes the distribution and central tendency of age at the town level.

The population pyramid offers a clear macro-level view, showing a narrowing base of youth and an expanding older population—a hallmark of an aging society. This broad observation sets the stage for deeper investigation.\n\nTo explore regional variations, we transitioned to density plots that highlight how age distribution differs across Singapore’s five regions. These plots uncovered distinct demographic peaks—for instance, younger population clusters in the North-East, and more mature age groups in Central and East regions.\n\nBuilding on this, we employed violin and boxplots to zoom into each region’s planning areas, allowing for a more granular understanding of intra-regional differences. This visual dissection surfaced insights like the relative youth of areas such as Sengkang and Punggol, contrasted with the aging profiles of mature estates like Queenstown and Bukit Merah.\n\nTogether, these visualisations form a layered narrative—from national structure, to regional patterns, to local planning area details. They provide an insightful foundation for urban planners, policymakers, and social services to adapt strategies in line with Singapore’s evolving demographic realities.\n\n## \n\n📌 The above code chunk and narratives were assisted by ChatGPT with numerous hours of prompting and checking the output.\n",
