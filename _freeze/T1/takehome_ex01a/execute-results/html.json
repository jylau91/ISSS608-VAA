Classic pyramid chart with distinct representation of Females and Males by Age Group.\n\n2.  Age Groups are logically sorted from youngest to oldest, aligns with natural age progression.\n\n3.  Y Axis label and title is clear and interpretable.\n\nImprovement notes:\n\n1.  X-Axis label for Males is at a negative value (-100,000) which is hard to inteprete (i.e. counter intuitive). Title can clearly also describe Population Size as Population may represent score or size per area as the title suggests \"Population Area\".\n\n2.  Color Legend used to represent Female / Male is confusing as Males are conventially represented by Blue and Females Red/Pink. The legend label is also inverse of the chart representation as readers typically read from left to right, Males should be be presented first followed by Female.\n\n3.  No value labels and x-axis labels are represented too far aapart to tell the differences in values between Females and Males especially in age groups 30 to 64 as the bars on both sides are almost of equal length.\n:::\n",
