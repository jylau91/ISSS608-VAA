Classic pyramid chart with distinct representation of Females and Males by Age Group.\n\n2.  Age Groups are logically sorted from youngest to oldest, aligns with natural age progression.\n\n3.  Y Axis label and title is clear and interpretable.\n\nImprovement notes:\n\n1.  X-Axis label for Males is at a negative value (-100,000) which is hard to inteprete (i.e. counter intuitive). Title can clearly also describe Population Size as Population may represent score or size per area as the title suggests \"Population Area\".\n\n2.  Color Legend used to represent Female / Male is confusing as Males are conventially represented by Blue and Females Red/Pink. The legend label is also inverse of the chart representation as readers typically read from left to right, Males should be be presented first followed by Female.\n\n3.  No value labels and x-axis labels are represented too far apart (100,000 intervals) to tell the differences in values between Females and Males especially in age groups 30 to 64 as the bars on both sides are almost of equal length.\n\nFixes:\n\n1.  Correct X-Axis label to positive values and change X-Axis title to Population Size\n2.  Change Color Legend - Male: Blue and Female: Pink. Change Legend position to the bottom to co-incide with the left label for male and right label for female for easy visual reference.\n3.  Add value labels and decrease X-Axis value intervals to 50,000 and Format Y-Axis Labels to remove \"\\_\" spacers to improve readability.\n\nWe will perform the Fixes subsequently in section 4, as we will need to re-load the correct dataset to proceed as well.\n:::\n\n### 3.2 Selected Visualisation #2 - **Box Plot based on Age Range**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFA_order <- c(\"<= 60\", \">60 to 80\", \">80 to 100\", \">100 to 120\", \">120\", \"Not Available\")\nResident_Data$FA <- factor(Resident_Data$FA, levels = FA_order)\n\nggplot(Resident_Data, aes(x = FA, y = Pop)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Population by Functional Age Range (FA)\", x = \"FA Band\", y = \"Population\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](takehome_ex01a_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nx\n\n::: callout-note\n## Critique of student's visualisation #2\n\nWhile the visualisation has significant conceptual flaws, we note the following positive notes:\n\n1.  Use of categorical data as columns, with logical meaningful order (if interpreted correctly).\n2.  Attempt to use boxplot to show spread of population across different age groups\n3.  Clean theme and layout to show spread of data.\n\nImprovement notes, in addition to data corrections as mentioned earlier (i.e. misinterpretation of FA):\n\n1.  Include meaningful categorical labels per age group for representation of the category and ease understanding by the reader.\n2.  Ensure Y-Axis Label is corrected to Population Size to ease interpretation\n3.  Interapability of chart can be improved as the outliers from the boxplot has almost formed a line all the categorical groups, which may be due to either data or the lacking of grouping e.g. by subzone.\n\nFixes:\n\n1.  Age groups to be divided into standard 5 year bins, as the correct data set provides the age in a continous variable.\n2.  Improve on axis title and value labels.\n3.  Group population size data by planning areas, and label outliers for further exploration and investigations.\n\nWe will perform the Fixes subsequently in section 4, as we will need to re-load the correct dataset to proceed as well.\n:::\n\n## 4.0 Visualisation Makeover\n\n### 4.1 Loading the Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\")\n\nglimpse(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 60,424\nColumns: 6\n$ PA   <chr> \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo K…\n$ SZ   <chr> \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio T…\n$ Age  <chr> \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"4\", \"4\", \"5\", \"5\", \"6\", …\n$ Sex  <chr> \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Male…\n$ Pop  <dbl> 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 30, 10, 3…\n$ Time <dbl> 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024,…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 4.2 Clean the dataset\n\nConvert the Age90+ to 90 to obtain a continous variable as Age_Num.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Age_Num = if_else(Age == \"90_and_Over\", 90, as.numeric(Age)),\n    Population = Pop\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### 4.3 Fixes on Visualisation 1\n\nRecap:\n\n1.

The original FA-based plot, by contrast, offers limited clarity and analytical value due to coarse banding, absent labeling, and flat styling.\n\n## 🔍 **Top-Level Insights**\n\n### 1. 📊 **Young Adults (25–34) Have the Highest Concentration**\n\n-    The **30–34** age group has the **highest mean population** among all 5-year bands, marked by the \"Highest mean\" label.\n\n-    This suggests a demographic bulge of working-age adults settling in certain planning areas—likely due to employment opportunities, housing preferences, or family formation phase.\n\n### 2. 🧒 **Children and Teen Groups (0–19) Have Lower Populations**\n\n-    Age groups from **0–4** to **15–19** have **lower medians (Q2)** and are **below the overall mean**.\n\n-   This may reflect Singapore’s low birth rate or population aging dynamics.\n\n### 3. 👵 **Elderly Population (75+) Shows Sparse but Notable Outliers**\n\n-    Median values drop sharply after **70–74**, showing a decreasing elderly concentration per PA.\n\n-    However, **Bedok** is labeled as an outlier in multiple senior age groups (75–79, 80–84, 90+), indicating a **high concentration of elderly residents** in that area.\n\n## 📌 **Outlier Insights**\n\n### 🔺 **Sengkang** (Age Group: 5–9)\n\n-    Marked as an outlier in the **5–9** age group, suggesting a **relatively younger, family-oriented population cluster** in Sengkang.\n\n### 🔺 **Bedok** (Ages: 75–90+)\n\n-    Appears multiple times as an outlier across **three senior age brackets**, highlighting it as a **key aging community**.\n\n-    Urban planners and eldercare service providers may need to prioritize resource allocation here.\n\n## 📉 **Decline in Population Beyond Age 70**\n\n-    Population medians drop consistently after the **65–69** age group.\n\n-   This pattern aligns with natural mortality trends and indicates a potential **transition point** in population dependency dynamics.\n\n## 📎 **Statistical Markers Aid Interpretation**\n\n-    The **overall mean** (\\~6,000–7,000) acts as a baseline for comparison across age groups.\n\n-    **Median (Q2)** labels reinforce central tendency per age group and show where distributions are skewed.\n\n## 🧠 **Planning & Policy Implications**\n\n-    **Infrastructure needs** for the 30–44 age group (e.g., housing, childcare, transport) should remain a priority.\n\n-    **Targeted support** for elderly PAs like Bedok is critical (e.g., healthcare, accessibility upgrades).\n\n-    **Youth support** policies could be reviewed in PAs with persistently low young population levels.\n:::\n",
